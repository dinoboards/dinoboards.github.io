# Dinoboard Retro Computer Kits

I have designed and developed a number of retro computer kits, based on technology from the 1980s.  They are designed around the RC2014 and RCBus platforms.

There are 2 main sets of kits:

* *Yellow MSX Series* - a series of RC2014/RCBus compatible modules, when connected together allow for a full working reproduction of an original MSX Computer
* *Green Mean Machine Series* - a new series under development based around the eZ80 CPU - the *enhanced Z80* CPU from Zilog


## Mean Green Machine Series

### eZ80 for RC

The *eZ80 for RC* is a CPU Module designed for the RCBus and RC2014<strong>&trade;</strong> backplanes.

    <p>The eZ80 for RC module is an alternative CPU module for your RC2014 or RCBus based computer.  Upgrade your Z80 to Zilog enhanced version of the chip.  Running at 20Mhz (and overclockable to 40Mhz or more), and take advantage of its many on-chip facilities such as flash ROM, RAM, GPIO and much more.</p>
