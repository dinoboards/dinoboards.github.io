### General guidelines

#### Soldering item order

Generally, you want to solder items from lowest height to largest height.  Review the components you need to solder, and note their progressive heights.

1. Resistors.
2. Small ceramic capacitors.
3. Any other low height components.
4. The right angle headers (these headers are slightly lower in height than the IC sockets).*
5. IC sockets, ensuring the sockets are fully flat (solder one or 2 pins first, and visually check its flat before soldering their other pins).
6. Electrolytic capacitors (note the correct orientation).
7. Larger connectors, and any other remaining items.

> \* Note the right angle headers are position correctly and lay flush and at right angle to the main PCB.
