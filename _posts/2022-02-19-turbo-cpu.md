<p>Another module I been developing in the MSX for RC2014 series is the Turbo CPU.&nbsp; This is a module that run the Z80 at 20Mhz, instead of the stock 3.5Mhz speed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This module is not designed to a particular MSX standard - but I wanted to make my machine go a little faster, yet still be compatible (for the most part) with existing software/games.</p>


<figure><img style="width: 720px; height: 385.802px;" width="720" height="385.802" class="lazy" src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/1439541645317971957.jpg"></figure>


<p>The compatibility issue is not a simple one, when you increase the CPU speed, to 20Mhz, many other chips in the system will not be able to keep up.&nbsp; And in particular the V9958 will have issues.&nbsp; A lot of software written for the MSX, assumed its running on a Z80 at 3.5Mhz, and will have issues, typically with video, if this is not the case.</p>


<p>MSX did come out with a 'faster' machine - the Turbo MSX.&nbsp; They solve the compatibility issue by having 2 CPUs.&nbsp; &nbsp;A&nbsp;stock Z80 running at the 3.5Mhz for compatibility and a R800 (basically a custom Z80, similar to the Z180/280 etc, that ran much faster).&nbsp; Unlike the Z80, the R800 is not available today - at least not as a recently manufactured brand new item&nbsp;</p>


<p>The fastest Z80 this is available today, in DIP40 configuration is rated at 20Mhz (and can probably go faster).&nbsp; A MSX running at 20Mhz - sounds super fast to this old-timer!</p>


<p>The typical way for the Z80 to manage access to devices with slower timing requirements, is by triggering hardware wait-states.&nbsp; So when the Z80 requests an I/O operation - we need to hold Z80's wait line active for a small number of clock cycles - allowing the communication with other devices to be 'slowed'.&nbsp;<br></p>


<p>The number of clocks cycles that need to be 'waited' is dependant on the speed of your Z80 and the timing requirements of the other chips.&nbsp; For a generic designed circuit, suitable for a most situations, we need to wait for the slowest component in the system.</p>


<p>But we also need to consider more than just the timing requirements for IO communications.&nbsp; The Video (V9958) is a processor also - and when it receives commands from the Z80 - it will take its own time to process those commands.&nbsp; The chip has its own clock - and as such will work through it logic, at its own independant pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>So any software that assumes its running on a Z80 at 3.5Mhz, but is actually running at 20Mhz, will probably have severe&nbsp;video corruptions as it issues commands to the V9958 at a rate far too high.</p>


<p>We could solve this issue by waiting (pausing) the Z80 every time it communicates with the V9958 VDP, but we would need a fairly large counter to ensure good operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>Another approach to solving the timing requirements, is instead of using hardware wait states, we just simply 'slow' down the Z80's clock when it initiates any I/O operations.&nbsp; That is, we switch the Z80 to the standard 3.5Mhz when it starts an I/O operation, and maintain that speed for a number of cycles, before resuming to full speed.&nbsp; So from the view of the running software, its timing to the V9958 will be unchanged. When the Z80 goes on to do other operations - it will resume at full speed.&nbsp; Well least that's the theory - there is only one sure way to find out if this works.&nbsp;</p>


<p><em>&nbsp;(The&nbsp;GR8BIT has published a similar&nbsp;mod for their system: <a href="http://kb.gr8bit.ru/KB0009/GR8BIT-KB0009-Accelerating-your-GR8BIT.html">http://kb.gr8bit.ru/KB0009/GR8BIT-KB0009-Accelerating-your-GR8BIT.html</a>, so that gave me hope this would work)</em></p>


<p>Of course, a Z80, doesn't just communicate with I/O devices - it also accesses RAM and ROM, across the RC2014 bus.&nbsp; Will the memory chips keep up?&nbsp; Will the RC2014 bus operate at this speed ok?&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, the timing for the ROM and RAM chips will not work at 20Mhz - but if we note that although the Z80 is running at 20Mhz, it will not access memory at this speed.&nbsp; Again, only way to truly know, is to try it out.</p>


<p>So I came up with a design that has the following characteristics:</p>


<p>1. use a 3 way slider to 'switch' the operation mode into 1 of 3 modes:</p>


<ul><li>Mode 1: Lock the CPU at 3.5Mhz - i.e. standard MSX compatibility mode</li><li>Mode 2: Run CPU at 20Mhz, with clock slowed down for I/O, and additional memory request wait states</li><li>Mode 3: Run CPU at 20Mhz, with clock slowed down for I/O, and fewer memory wait stats</li></ul>


<p>2. When operating in Turbo Mode, the Z80 CPU and CLK1 and CLK2 bus lines are using independent clocks</p>


<p>3. Use PLDs to allow me to configure the number of wait states and clock slow down periods - so I can optimised the timing</p>


<p>4. I calculated that I would need to hold the clock slow for about 32 (@3.5Mhz) cycles upon any I/O operations to ensure that existing software will not overload the V9958</p>


<p>5. Use a socket for the 'Turbo' oscillator, so I can replace it with alternative values to allow for testing and experimentation</p>


<p>6. Have jumpers so I can select speeds for CLK1 and CLK2 bus lines as well as whether Turbo mode uses the onboard oscillator (20Mhz) or the 7Mhz clock</p>


<p>7. The RC2014 CLK1 and CLK2 are configurable as per the stock RC2104 dual clock module</p>


<p>8. Using higher speed CMOS chips were required to operate at the 20Mhz speed</p>


<p>9. Integrate a clock synchronising circuit, so that when we switch from 20Mhz to 3.5Mhz, that the phase differences are handled ensuring the Z80 always has a clean clock.&nbsp; I stole the design from (<a href="http://www.6502.org/mini-projects/clock-switching/clock-switching.html">http://www.6502.org/mini-projects/clock-switching/clock-switching.html</a>)</p>


<p>Results:</p>


<ul><li>With Turbo Mode 3, my RC2014 in MSX configuration, boots into MSX-DOS perfectly and much quicker.&nbsp; MSX-BASIC works perfect in Turbo Mode.</li><li>Testing on a stock RC2014 also works - CP/M and MBASIC work just fine.</li><li>Serial communications now run much faster.</li><li>Had Pacman running just fine in the Turbo Mode (running using SOFAROM).&nbsp; Seems to me to run at exactly the same rate.&nbsp; So there is no advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Other games, loaded in RAM via SOFAROM,&nbsp; also work just fine.</li><li>External cartridges typically don't like working in Turbo Mode - the old memory chips cant cope.</li><li>My MegaFlashRom also did not like Turbo mode.&nbsp;</li><li>When slider is in Mode 1 (compatible 3.5Mhz) - everything works as standard.</li><li>Ran some MSX benchmark utilities - and according to those I have a much faster MSX.</li></ul>


<p>Here is a video of the module in operation, in an MSX configured RC2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>One gotcha</strong></p>


<p>I discovered there is one issue with running in Turbo CPU mode.&nbsp; In particular the SIO/2 module would not work correctly and I could not get serial communication to work.</p>


<p>The Zilog SIO chip (and other Zilog chips), have a requirements that their supplied clock is the same as the CPU Clock.&nbsp; When operating in Turbo Mode, the Z80 clock and the SIO/2 (driven by CLK1) are not in sync as per the SIO/2 requirement.</p>


<p>The SIO/2 needs the clocks in sync, to enable a feature where the SIO/2 chip will release it interrupt state automatically.&nbsp; It does this, by&nbsp;inspecting, via the data bus, what instructions the Z80 is executing.&nbsp; It's looking for when the Z80 has executed the <strong><em>RETI&nbsp;</em></strong>(<em>Return from Interrupt</em>) instruction.&nbsp; When it see this, it can then&nbsp;release its interrupt state/latching flags.</p>


<p>If it doesn't see the <strong><em>RETI</em></strong>, then the interrupt triggering will not work correctly.&nbsp; In the case of the SIO, you get one interrupt when data comes in, but there after, no more interrupts will be raised.</p>


<p>By running the Z80 clock asynchronously to the SIO/2, the SIO/2 is not able to inspect the Z80 operation.&nbsp; The SIO/2 will not know the Z80 is running at a different clock, and so might even see what it thinks is a <strong><em>RETI </em></strong>- when in fact the Z80 did not finish its interrupt handling*.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<p>To get serial communication working, in Turbo mode, I found 2 solutions that can be used:</p>


<p>1. Prior to executing the <strong><em>RETI</em></strong>, we perform an I/O instruction, thus dropping the Z80 down to 3.5Mhz in sync with the SIO/2.<br></p>


<p>2. Explicitly tell the SIO to unlatch it interrupt flag.</p>


<p>For MSX, I had to go with the 2nd option in my serial driver.&nbsp; Option 1 would be difficult to implement, as it requires changing the interrupt handling code in the system BIOS.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the MSX standard does not use any Zilog I/O I think this is fine.</p>


<p>For RomWBW, I will need to submit a patch to&nbsp;Wayne Warthen, that integrates the changes as per option 1.</p>


<p>* My experiments to date, using option 1 and 2, have produced very reliable and fast serial communications - so I gather that this is not really a problem.</p>


<p>I will add this module to my Tindie store soon.&nbsp; The GitHub site for it is on my dev branch at:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/vipoo/yellow-msx-series-for-rc2014/tree/dev/turbo-cpu">https://github.com/vipoo/yellow-msx-series-for-rc2014/tree/dev/turbo-cpu</a></p>
