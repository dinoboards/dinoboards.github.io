Okay,

This one has been quite an effort to get here.  But I finally have a version of the Cassette/USB module completed.  About to list the product on Tindie.

It was a huge effort developing the software for it.  There was a lot of 2 steps forward, 1 step back, 1 step side, and a few loop-do-loops!

Learning how USB protocols work for floppy, flash thumbs drives and old magnetic external HDD has been quite a journey.

After this massive effort, I can now :

Load a BASIC program from cassette (and save), then save it to a USB Flash drive.
Boot MSX-DOS/Nextor from a flash drive (and use the same drive on my PC for quick file transfer)
Read and write to 1.44MB and 720K 3.5" Floppy disks
Format the floppies
And also - something that I think was kind of cool.  I got a USB to Centronics adapter and can now print to my 9pin dot matrix printer.

I have released on new ROM image on GitHub, that has all the new drivers and software.
