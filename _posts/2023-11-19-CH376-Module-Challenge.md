Can you tell the difference between these modules - they are both sold as CH376 Modules?

</div>

Both were purchased from ebay/aliexpress traders. Both are sold as CH376 modules.  Both have the same CH376 chip.

The one of the left though, has a different pin out.  Notice the 2x3 header pin.  Whereas, the one on the right only has a 1x3 pin header.  And just to add to the change,  the main headers have been swapped.  For the left/original, the outermost pins are the data lines, and for the right, its the inner most pins.

This alternative form-factor is not compatible with my PCB design.

On my Tindie store, I had packaged up some kits - and only at the last minute did I notice this very different pinout/form factor change.  I very nearly sent out kits with an incompatible module!

I have not been able to source any more of the module as shown on the left.  Only seem to get the one on the right.

It now seems that the ebay/ali-express traders are only selling the one on the right -- even if their product page shows the original 2x3 pin header.  You just can not trust what you will end up getting.

So I had to redesign the PCB for my Cassette+USB kit to accommodate the change.  As this is just a form factor/pin out change - the software and electronics all still work the same.  Only need to re-route and reposition the cut outs on my PCB.

So now I have 2 PCB versions for this kit, to accommodate the 2 form factors:

</div>

I have just assembled a kit using this new module form factor - and so far all seems to work just fine.  I do need to do a bit of testing to double check everything.  So if u are waiting to get one of these kits - I can hopefully have new stock listed next weekend.
