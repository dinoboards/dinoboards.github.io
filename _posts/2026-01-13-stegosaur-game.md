Next module to be downsized, is the YM2149 Game Module.

Like the other modules, it is an alternative to the Yellow Module.  With some difference - and the big visual difference is the height reduction.

Let me highlight some of the key changes:


### Pseudo Stereo Output

By popular demand, I have updated the design to incorporate the 'golden ratio' stereo mix.  I am not 100% sure where it first appeared - I see references to [https://hw.speccy.cz/ayinterface.html](https://hw.speccy.cz/ayinterface.html) - so not 100% sure who to credit.  Many kits based on the YM2149/AY-3-8910 chip have implemented this output circuit.

</div>

The chip has three separate channel outputs (A, B and C) - and by using some resistors dividers to spread the signals across the left and right channels, we get a very full wall of stereo sounds for our games and music playing programs.

Updating the GAME module to produce stereo output, also meant I needed to update the design of the MSX Music module to passthrough this stereo mix.  So its design also had to be updated.  More on that in the next post.

### Controller Connectors

In comparison to the Yellow MSX module, I remove the game controller DB9 connectors to an optional expansion board.

This new revised packaging should help anyone who wants to place their kit in a custom designed case.  As most games and applications will work just fine using the keyboard, the lack of a controller interface is not too big a deal.

### Optional Support for AY-3-8910

An extra jumper and an optional on-board clock divider circuit, and we can support the very similar and compatible chip - the AY-3-8910.

### Dropped the on-board clock

In the interest of saving space and simplifying as much as possible, I removed the on-board clock generator.  This module is expected to get a clock signal from the main bus (CLK1 or CLK2).  Typically that will be generated by the V99x8 RGB Module - which will be used by this module and some other modules of the series.

### More details

I have more details of the module and schematic up on my site now: [https://www.dinoboards.com.au/stegosaur/game/](https://www.dinoboards.com.au/stegosaur/game/)
