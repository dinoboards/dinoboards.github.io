<p>One of the final things missing from the Yellow MSX series of kits for the RC2014, is the ability to access typical MSX storage devices (floppy and cassette).<br></p>

<p>Without storage such as this, its hard to claim that we have achieved full MSX compatibility.</p>


<p>There are plenty of schematics online for how to give the MSX access to cassette storage.&nbsp; Its not a very complicate design -- that is the easy part - although I have yet to get a working old-timey cassette player that works - so that makes it hard to test and validate cassette storage!</p>


<p>For the floppy interface, I&nbsp;considered designing something based on the work of&nbsp;Dr. Scott M. Baker (<a href="https://www.smbaker.com/z80-retrocomputing-part-14-rc2014-floppy-controller-boards">https://www.smbaker.com/z80-retrocomputing-part-14-rc2014-floppy-controller-boards</a>).&nbsp; I have actually built one of his designs for the RC2014 CPM configuration - and its worked well - it would only need the appropriate software driver written to support MSX-DOS/Nextor.</p>


<p>But I decided to go for a different and slightly more modern approach and create a USB interface for the system.&nbsp; Based on the very cheap and easy to source CH376 modules.&nbsp; There has been a fair bit of effort by some members of the MSX community to support this module.&nbsp; The work done to date was invaluable to get the software and hardware working:&nbsp;</p>

<p>By going with USB it gives me:<br></p>


<p>* A more reliable access to floppy - purchasing cheap new USB drives, will be more reliable than attempting to use old used floppy hardware.</p>


<p>* Aside from floppy, we can access many other storage systems: flash storage, USB HDD, etc - making it easy to transfer files from a PC to the system</p>


<p>* Other device types can be considered - if the software can be written - such as network interface, serial interface, keyboards - so many possibilities - although the software work is quite demanding.</p>


<p>I have uploaded 3 videos that shows the work in progress for access floppy, flash storage.&nbsp; The driver written to-date, currently supports many USB thumb drivers - and I have tested the floppy access for 2 floppy drives (an older IBM/Teac drive and a brand new no-brand drive from ebay)</p>

<p>It took an enormous effort for me to learn how to access drives over usb, how to use the various USB protocol/standards for floppies, flash and hub access.&nbsp; The software still has more work -- it currently is about 8k in length.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>


<p>The video shows an early version of the PCB and schematic.&nbsp; It changes a bit.&nbsp; With better physical support for the CH376 module and the layout for the cassette design (cassette is yet to be tested and validated)</p>
