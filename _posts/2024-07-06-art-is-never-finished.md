<strong>Art is never finished only abandoned</strong>

Don't worry - I haven't abandon the project.

I've been working on the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/dinotron/ym2413-msx-music-module-designed-for-rc2014/">MSX Music Module</a> (and listed a new revision in my Tindie store).

This revision further reduces some of that annoying digital background noise that could be heard when no music or sound playing. Its still emanate some background noise -- I think it be very hard to eliminate as so much of the various RC2014 modules will generate a lot of EMF noise.

The latest revision (1.9), increases the gain of the op-amp stage and adjusted some of the capacitors on the feedback.&nbsp;This seems to improve the signal to noise ratio, and it also improved its higher frequency responses.&nbsp; Its sound much brighter.
